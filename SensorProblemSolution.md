# Sensor Code Problems and Solutions
We had a lot of bleh blhe 
## Problem 1: Could not get the Sensor code to autoboot
* [Autobooting](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-PI-auto-boot/) is when the computer ( in this case, the Raspberry Pi) automatically starts running a programming script when it turns on. 
* Usually, once you turn on a computing device, you have to then go an additional step to run the code you want to run on the computer. Automooting takes this additional step away. 
* When I first tried to configure an autoboot onto the Raspberry Pi, I noticed that none of the methods that I tried implementing were working. I tried around 7 different methods described in [this website](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-PI-auto-boot/)
