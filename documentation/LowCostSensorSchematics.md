# Low Cost Sensor Documentation

## Background
Below is documentation of the components used and their arrangment for the sensors we used during the 2021 Atlanta Science Festival. A small computer called an [Arduino](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/mkr2uno-adapter) was used to process data collected by the laser particle sensor. This data was then displayed on a small LED display. The measurements taken and displayed were as follows:

### Measurements
* EPA Air Quality Standard (On a scale from Good-Harmful)
```
Moderate
``` 
* PM 2.5 Concentration
```
17
```
### Set-up
Set-up for the sensor is as follows: 
Make sure you have all necessary components, laser particle sensor, Arduino (link can be found above), breadboard, LCD display, wire packet. The following image can be used as a guide for sensor assembly. The wire column indicates the necessary wire color, the second column indicates what you are connecting and where on the breadboard one must initially insert the wire. The third column indicates what you are connecting to and where the other end of the wire should be inserted.
