### Check out our [EmoryAQ](https://emoryair.github.io/) website.

## Goals

1. [Here](https://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.markercluster/example/marker-clustering-realworld.388.html) is the example of the type of map we would like to implement 
2. Multipaged, tabs included 
3. Graph analysis shows up when sensor location is clicked 
4. Ideally, we would like to combine the heat map coloration with the graphs similar to [PurpleAir](https://www.purpleair.com/map?#1/25/-30)
