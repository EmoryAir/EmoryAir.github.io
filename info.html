		<h1>Information</h1>
        <p>
            Emory Air Quality (Emory AQ) is an effort to monitor and report air quality around Emory University’s Main Campus. The high levels of development and traffic in and around Emory University raised the question “how clean is the air we breathe?”. For this reason, Emory AQ currently monitors <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fpm-pollution&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEqR11NWDIwpo629hjVJ-ZLgCEoew">particulate matter</a>(PM), temperature, and <a href= "http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Finfo.zehnderamerica.com%2Fblog%2Fabsolute-vs.-relative-humidity-whats-the-difference&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGKyimweguSCjQ_zWQhgUe2AAd6kQ">relative humidity</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>What is PM?</h3>
        <p>
            Particulate Matter (PM) consists of small particles and liquid droplets suspended in the air. Their chemical properties are determined the composition of these solid and liquid particles. We measure PM using a <a href= "http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dylosproducts.com%2Fornodcproair.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFynFzk83b1Evs7FTrJv1rswOeLfw">Dylos sensor</a> which divides PM into two categories:  2.5 to 10 micrometers in diameter(PM10), and 2.5 micrometers or smaller in diameter(PM2.5). The <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww3.epa.gov%2Fregion1%2Fairquality%2Fpm-aq-standards.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFX2pLT3u8gqZg6mwxXjcMmmmQElA">national standard</a> for PM2.5 is 12 μg/m3 and for PM10 is 35 μg/m3.
        </p>
        <h3>Environmental and Health Concerns</h3>
        <p>
            PM, when inhaled, possesses a risk of aggravating or causing cardiorespiratory problems: asthma, lung and heart disease, difficulty breathing, and irritation. The smaller the particle, the deeper they can penetrate into your lungs, or even your blood stream. For this reason, PM2.5 poses a greater health risk than PM10, pollen, or other large dust particles.

            Environmentally, the chemical composition of PM can contribute to chemical weathering, damage crops, and alter the pH of aquatic ecosystems.

            The EPA can provide more information <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fpm-pollution%2Fhealth-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNElmxSpgWLo-GFN3wPaUtEQgU6rgg">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>How Do We Report Air Quality?</h3>
        <p>
            The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) establishes a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for five major air pollutants (ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide), regulated by the Clean Air Act. These standards are used to establish the U.S <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fairnow.gov%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFS4YIywU9_sxj0aIv8ZHirkuvIAQ">Air Quality Index</a> (AQI), a reporting index that categorizes the air into six degrees of health concern. For PM2.5, the <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.epa.gov%2Fcriteria-air-pollutants%2Fnaaqs-table&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHbdp9pAbh9QWYGaNpJy6KdJ0ayHw">AQI criteria</a> for “Good”, satisfactory air with little or no risk is 12.0 μg/m3. Anything beyond this threshold introduces risk to sensitive groups, such as those with asthma, and other people, as air quality decreases further.
        </p>
        <h3>Assumptions</h3>
        <p>
            In order to translate from PM to volume of particulates, we assumed that all particles are spherical and we used an average density to calculate the volume of PM(μg/m3). Both <a href= "https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mdpi.com%2F1424-8220%2F18%2F2%2F59&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFodj_R1fIVMH90Ok9iYj_AsmF_sQ">temperature and humidity</a> affect the sensors that measure PM, which may skew the data in extreme conditions.
